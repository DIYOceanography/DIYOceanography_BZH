Why DIY Oceanography BZH?
=========================

Motivation
----------

Projects including developments of open DIY monitoring systems of the ocean have been multiplying over the last couple of years and worldwide [BUT2021]_ [MAR2021]_.
Our objective is too centralize knowledge and material that may foster the development these projects.

Our effort has been so far conducted from Brest (France) with members principally from the academic *... to develop*


Scope
-----

The ongoing effort of our working group focuses on sensors_, the movitation being that they consitute the cornerstone for all instruments.
Taking one variable of interest at a time, we wish to gather useful information related to sensing physics *... to develop*

.. xrft can track the metadata in ``xarray.DataArray`` (:doc:`example <./MITgcm_example>`),
.. which makes it easy for large data sets.
.. The choice of Python and Anaconda also makes xrft :ref:`extremely easy to install <installation-label>`.
