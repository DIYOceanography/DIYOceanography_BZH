    "Temperature is a state variable, i.e. it is one of the parameters defining the thermodynamic equilibrium state of a system, and is an intensive property as it is independent of the quantity of matter in that system. This makes it a crucial variable to measure when determining the state of a system, whatever the field of application.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ocean, temperature range between -2°C and 40°C and conditions the evolution of ocean circulation, climate system and marine habitats. It determines water density (in conjunction with salinity and pressure) and reflects the amount of energy stored and absorbed by oceans [Chang et al. 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00376-020-9283-7). [Sea surface temperature](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-sea-surface-temperature) (SST), [ocean heat](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-ocean-heat) and [marine heat waves](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-marine-heat-waves) are clear climate change indicators directly linked to temperature measurements. Temperature is the easiest ocean property to measure. Except for deep observations, temperature measurements can be easy to handle and useful to coastal communities. The combinaison of temperature measurements over a large areas shows the trend of temperature in time and space [Chang et al. 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00376-020-9283-7) which can be used to study and predict marine life migration [Womersley et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-024-02129-5). Therefore an accurate use of temperature measurements by anyone going at sea is beneficial at a large scale.\n",

    "Temperature depends on depth, location and time, so different measurements are regularly needed depending on the area of interest. Sea surface temperature *add something here*. At great depths, water pressure induces a variation in temperature measured in relation to the heat capacity of the water mass in question, so a potential temperature must be defined. It's also important to note that the definition of a temperature value is based on a standard (first defined in 1700 by Mr. Celsius, who defined 0°C as the temperature at which fresh water at 0m altitude boils), and these standards have changed over time. This question is particularly important to compare historical measurements. Temperatures specified using the International Practical Temperature Scale 1968 (IPTS-68) differ from ITS-90 by up to 0.01°C over the range of oceanographic interest.\n",

    "## Remote sensing: Thermal radiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote temperature measurement captures the intensity of infrared wavelength emissions from an observed area. Matter emits electromagnetic radiation over a spectrum (see Figure ...). Compared to contact sensing, thermal radiation is a non-intrusive measurement, which makes it ideal for SST measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The peak emission depends on the temperature and shifts towards shorter wavelengths as temperature increases ([Wien's displacement law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law)). For example, the sun, at a temperature of 5900 K, has a maximum luminous intensity in the “visible” wavelengths (from a human point of view), whereas a human does not spontaneously emit in the visible range; at around 37°C, their maximum intensity is in the infrared wavelength range.\n",
    "\n",
    "A body's spectrum can be approximated using a few hypotheses by the [black-body spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation), described by Planck's Law. The integration of the black-body spectrum over the wavelengths (and [solid angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_angle) if needed) gives the power per unit surface emitted by the black-body. Finally, you can compute the temperature associated with the emission using [Stefan-Boltzmann's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan–Boltzmann_law) and [emissivity](https://thermalprocessing.com/what-pyrometer-users-need-to-know/). Sea surface emissivity must be appropriately taken into account depending on the wavelength [Masuda et al. 1988](https://doi.org/10.1016/0034-4257(88)90032-6). More information can be found in [Theory and Practice of Radiation Thermometry](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470172575).\n",

If relevant, the lens should be [carefully chosen](https://oem.flir.com/fr-fr/learn/discover/Considerations-for-Thermal-Lens-Selection/) and its effect may be considered. The detector converts the IR energy into an electric signal. The electric signal is amplified and can either be a raw output (radiometric measurements) or processed (thermographic measurements).\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The detectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The detector transforms the thermal energy into electrical energy. Different types of detectors can be used, which will modify the cost and the time response of the instrument. Usually, the microbolometer (change of electrical resistance) is the cheapest solution. Thermopiles (made of several thermocouples) and MEMS thermopiles are also used. Quantum detectors respond to IR by absorbing photons, such as Indium antimonide (InSb) or strained layer superlattice (SLS). Quantum detectors have faster responses than non-quantum detectors but need cooling to cryogenic temperatures to operate. More information can be found in [\"The Ultimate Infrared Handbook for R&D Professionals\"](http://www.flirmedia.com/MMC/THG/Brochures/T559243/T559243_EN.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now I realize that it would be better to have a dedicated page to develop the different components, such as lenses, filters, and detectors, as they are the actual sensors. For now, the \"remote sensing\" section is more about instrumentation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Radiometric measurements allow for accurate SST measurement when carefully post-processed. The main sources of error are a good representation of the sea surface spectrum (the sea surface is not a black body and its emissivity needs to be characterized) and atmospheric radiation. The sensor not only captures the object's radiation but also radiation from the environment, and the atmosphere emits where it absorbs sunlight (see solar spectrum Figure). Usually, filters are chosen between 10.5–12.5 μm (atmospheric window) to avoid atmospheric absorption bands without being too broad. The lens contribution may also affect the final result (see thermal camera section).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instruments using remote sensing include thermal cameras, pyrometers, and radiometers. Usually, thermal cameras and pyrometers output a temperature with low accuracy (the best I found so far is ±2°C for a thermal camera around 500€). However, combined measurements and intelligent post-processing may significantly increase accuracy [Robinson & Donjon 2010](https://doi.org/10.1080/1023673031000080385), [Zhang & Wang 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/s22051872). **Not great as a citation, it's MDPI, but I found the idea interesting.**\n",

    "### Electrical signal generation: Thermocouples\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermocouples produce an electrical signal due to temperature changes that can be transmitted and processed electronically. Thermocouples are inexpensive and easy to construct (see [How to make a Thermocouple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8cBCjJJcB4) or [Making a thermocouple](https://www.instructables.com/Making-A-Thermocouple/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Thermocouples are robust and versatile sensors with a fast time response. The sensor can be smaller than a few micrometers and flexible, so they are used in a wide range of applications [Zhang et al. 2022]. \n",
    "\n",
    "In oceanography, thermocouples are not usually used even though they can offer an interesting spatial resolution and fast response [Nash et al. 1999]. A detailed description of thermocouple construction can be found in [Marmorino et al. 1977].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermocouples work based on the Seebeck effect, where a voltage is generated at the junction of two dissimilar metals when there is a temperature difference between the junction and the ends of the metals. The history of thermoelectrics can be found [here](https://thermoelectrics.matsci.northwestern.edu/thermoelectrics/history.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the temperature difference increases along the metal, electrons spontaneously migrate towards the colder area. A potential difference is generated within each metal. The two metals have distinct electrical properties so that the voltage is different between the two ends of each metal. The potential difference between the two metals is called the contact electromotive force (EMF). \n",
    "\n",
    "The EMF produced is proportional to the temperature difference and to the Seebeck coefficient of the thermocouple. No voltage is measured if the two metals are similar or if there is no temperature difference. The higher the voltage produced, the easier it is to read and the less noisy the signal. Standard couples of metals are usually used (see [here](https://www.tcaus.com.au/thermocouple/thermocouple-standards.html) for more information on thermocouple standards).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Measurement process\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermocouples are placed at the desired location to measure temperature. The cold end provides the reference temperature $T_{ref}$ and must be measured (using another temperature sensor), whereas the voltage is measured at the hot end. The reference temperature is then used to compensate the voltage measured at the \"hot\" end. Finally, the thermocouple is either calibrated or its calibration curve is used to obtain the \"hot\" temperature knowing the voltage output. The voltage measured is small (a few mV, see figure) and is usually amplified, which adds noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "In two examples, thermocouples were mounted on profilers and measured high-frequency vertical temperature gradients [Nash et al. 1999], [Marmorino & Caldwell 1978]. The temperature reference (cold end) was the profiler internal temperature. In both studies, the amplified noise limited the measurement. Nash et al. compared the ability to measure viscous dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy with temperature-gradient measurements between thermistors and thermocouples. Thermocouples measured less variance than thermistors in turbulent patches with a relatively large temperature-gradient signal. **Maybe not to keep here** \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The different types of sensors\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermocouples are available in various types (e.g., Type K, Type T, Type J) depending on the metals used and the temperature range. \n",

    "In oceanography, chromel-constantan thermocouples (ANSI type E) are preferred since they have the highest EMF output of any standard metallic thermocouple at typical oceanic temperatures [Marmorino & Caldwell 1978]. \n",

    "### Liquid dilatation\n",
    "\n",
    "Liquid-glass thermometers were used in early oceanography to measure temperature, for instance, on the [Challenger expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenger_expedition) of 1873–1876. Nowadays, liquid-glass thermometers are mostly used as calibrations for electronic measurement systems [Emery and Thomson 2001].\n",

    "from [Boyce (1996)](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/40648199.pdf)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "The dilatation of a liquid at constant pressure is used to measure temperature changes. As the liquid temperature changes, its volume also changes. This dilation allows temperature measurement, such as in mercury or alcohol in-glass thermometers. Mercury expands in a near-linear manner, making it the most commonly used liquid.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measurement process\n",
    "\n",
    "The thermometer is lowered into the ocean. At a given depth, a reversing mechanism separates the mercury in the stem from the reservoir and captures the measurement [Emery and Thomson 2001].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages and limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Accuracy can be better than 0.01°C (0.005°C given in [Boyce 1996])\n",
    "- Easy to handle\n",
    "- No energy needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- Slow measurements\n",
    "- High pressure could deform or crush the thermometer\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "RTDs measure temperature by correlating the resistance of a metal (typically platinum) with temperature. The resistance increases linearly with temperature.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measurement process\n",
    "A wire with a given length and cross-section is wound so that the temperature is homogeneous. \n",
    "RTDs are placed in the environment to measure temperature. The resistance is measured and converted into temperature using a calibration curve. Resistance depends on the shape and length of the wire : if any modification is made, the sensor should be calibrated again. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The different types of sensors\n",
    "\n",
    "RTDs are available in various configurations, such as thin-film and wire-wound types. Different types of metals are used (Pt, Ni, Cu). The usual RTD is the \"Pt100\" which has a 100 $\\Omega$ at 0°C. \n",
