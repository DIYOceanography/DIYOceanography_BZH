    "Temperature is a state variable, i.e. it is one of the parameters defining the thermodynamic equilibrium state of a system, and is an intensive property as it is independent of the quantity of matter in that system. This makes it a crucial variable to measure when determining the state of a system, whatever the field of application.\n",

    "In the ocean, temperature range between -2°C and 40°C and conditions the evolution of ocean circulation, climate system and marine habitats. It determines water density (in conjunction with salinity and pressure) and reflects the amount of energy stored and absorbed by oceans [Chang et al. 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00376-020-9283-7). [Sea surface temperature](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-sea-surface-temperature) (SST), [ocean heat](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-ocean-heat) and [marine heat waves](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-marine-heat-waves) are clear climate change indicators directly linked to temperature measurements. Temperature measurements can be affordable and easy to make. On the coast, temperature can be measured by anyone and used in daily life, for industrial purposes and academic research. The combinaison of temperature measuements allow researchers to study tempeture evolution over a long period of time\n",

    "Temperature depends on depth, location and time, so different measurements are regularly needed depending on the area of interest *(add temperature profile figure)*. Sea surface temperature *add something here*. At great depths, water pressure induces a variation in temperature measured in relation to the heat capacity of the water mass in question, so a potential temperature must be defined. It's also important to note that the definition of a temperature value is based on a standard (first defined in 1700 by Mr. Celsius, who defined 0°C as the temperature at which fresh water at 0m altitude boils), and these standards have changed over time. This question is particularly important to compare historical measurements. Temperatures specified using the International Practical Temperature Scale 1968 (IPTS-68) differ from ITS-90 by up to 0.01°C over the range of oceanographic interest.\n",
