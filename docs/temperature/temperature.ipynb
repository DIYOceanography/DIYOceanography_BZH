    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Ocean temperature ranges between -2°C and 40°C. It controls the evolution of ocean circulation, climate systems, and marine habitats. Temperature determines water density (together with salinity and pressure) and hence conditions oceanic circulation. It reflects the amount of energy stored and absorbed by oceans [Cheng et al. 2020]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key climate indicators directly linked to temperature measurements include [sea surface temperature](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-sea-surface-temperature) (SST), [ocean heat content](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-ocean-heat), and [marine heat waves](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-marine-heat-waves).\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature varies with depth, location, and time. Sea surface temperature ranges between 2°C and 32°C (Figure [1](#SST_map)). SST is mostly observed using satellite measurements. Modern satellites can achieve horizontal resolution up to 1 km. However, not all satellites reach this resolution. Measurements are impossible near coasts and under clouds. Surface measurements fill these gaps. They are selected based on their characteristics (balancing coverage versus temporal resolution).\n",

    "Below the surface, temperature profiles change in time and space (Figure [2](#seatemperature_profile)). This is due to seasonal variation of heat input and mixing processes of various temporal scales. The strongest vertical temperature gradient occurs in the first tens of meters below the surface. This region is called the thermocline. Thermocline strength increases seasonally with sun and atmospheric heat input variations. A temperature change of 10°C between 0 m and 80 m depth is easily observed in summer. At the coast, in water depths less than 200 m, a secondary weaker thermocline forms near the bottom due to bottom friction. At greater depths, temperature slowly decreases. Variations of 10°C occur over more than 1 km depth (Figure [2](#seatemperature_profile)). At great depths, water pressure affects temperature measurements. This relates to the heat capacity of the water mass. Therefore, a potential temperature must be defined for accurate analysis.\n",

    "### Thermistor\n",
    "The word \"thermistor\" derives from the description \"thermally sensitive resistor\". Thermistor is a fundamental electrical component whos electrical resistance changes with temperature and was first discoverred in 1833 by M.Faraday. At this time, the mass productino of thermistor was challenging so that the commercial production only started in the 1930s. The development of high-performance semiconductor in the late 20th century significantly increase the sensor sensitivity precision and increased the operational temperature. Today thermistor is used for a wide range of application and is the main type of temperature sensor used in oceanographic measurements. \n",

    "\n",
    "Thermocouples produce an electrical signal due to temperature changes that can be transmitted and processed electronically. Thermocouples are inexpensive and easy to construct (see [How to make a Thermocouple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8cBCjJJcB4) or [Making a thermocouple](https://www.instructables.com/Making-A-Thermocouple/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Thermocouples are robust and versatile sensors with a fast time response (of the order of 1s []). The sensor can be smaller than a few micrometers and flexible, so they are used in a wide range of applications [Zhang et al. 2022]. \n",

    " A detailed description of thermocouple construction can be found in [Marmorino et al. 1977].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermocouples work based on the Seebeck effect, where a voltage is generated at the junction of two dissimilar metals when there is a temperature difference between the junction and the ends of the metals. The history of thermoelectrics can be found [here](https://thermoelectrics.matsci.northwestern.edu/thermoelectrics/history.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the temperature difference increases along the metal, electrons spontaneously migrate towards the colder area. A potential difference is generated within each metal. The two metals have distinct electrical properties so that the voltage is different between the two ends of each metal. The potential difference between the two metals is called the contact electromotive force (EMF). \n",
    "\n",
    "The EMF produced is proportional to the temperature difference and to the Seebeck coefficient of the thermocouple. No voltage is measured if the two metals are similar or if there is no temperature difference. The higher the voltage produced, the easier it is to read and the less noisy the signal. Standard couples of metals are usually used (see [here](https://www.tcaus.com.au/thermocouple/thermocouple-standards.html) for more information on thermocouple standards).\n",

    "#### Measurement process\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermocouples are placed at the desired location to measure temperature. The cold end provides the reference temperature $T_{ref}$ and must be measured (using another temperature sensor), whereas the voltage is measured at the hot end. The reference temperature is then used to compensate the voltage measured at the \"hot\" end. Finally, the thermocouple is either calibrated or its calibration curve is used to obtain the \"hot\" temperature knowing the voltage output. The voltage measured is small (a few mV, see figure) and is usually amplified, which adds noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "In two examples, thermocouples were mounted on profilers and measured high-frequency vertical temperature gradients [Nash et al. 1999], [Marmorino & Caldwell 1978]. The temperature reference (cold end) was the profiler internal temperature. In both studies, the amplified noise limited the measurement. Nash et al. compared the ability to measure viscous dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy with temperature-gradient measurements between thermistors and thermocouples. Thermocouples measured less variance than thermistors in turbulent patches with a relatively large temperature-gradient signal. **Maybe not to keep here** \n",

    "### General principle of thermal radiation \n",
    "\n",
    "Remote temperature measurement aims to capture the intensity of long wavelength emissions from an observed body. Matter emits electromagnetic radiation at different wavelenghts which constitutes a spectrum (see Figure [solar spectrum](#Solar_spectrum)). Compared to contact sensing, thermal radiation is a non-intrusive measurement, which makes it ideal for SST measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice all remote temperature instrument measure radiation over a given range of wavelength. The range is selected based on the expected temperature of the body since the peak emission depends on the body temperature and shifts towards shorter wavelengths as temperature increases ([Wien's displacement law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law)). For example, the sun, at a temperature of 5900 K, has a maximum luminous intensity in the “visible” wavelengths (from a human point of view), whereas SST whose temperature is between 2 and 32°C does not spontaneously emit in the visible range; but in the infrared and microwave wavelength range. \n",
    "\n",
    "The radiation captured by the instrument is a combinaison of what is emitted by the body of interest and the environment. When looking at the SST, measurements also capture what the atmosphere emits (and all the other bodys that may be present on the way). The atmosphere emits where it absorbs sunlight (see Figure [solar spectrum](#Solar_spectrum)). Usually, filters are chosen between 10.5–12.5 μm (atmospheric window) to avoid atmospheric absorption bands without being too broad. Once the radiation is corrected one can compute the temperature associated with the emission using [Stefan-Boltzmann's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan–Boltzmann_law). The approximations made at this stage are : 1) the SST mostly emits in the measured range 2)the spectrum is approximated by the [black-body spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation), described by Planck's Law. \n",
    "\n",
    "To correct the first approximations measurements can be made in several bands (such as in satelitte measurements). The second approximation is corrected by using a correction factor call the [emissivity](https://thermalprocessing.com/what-pyrometer-users-need-to-know/). Sea surface emissivity must be appropriately taken into account depending on the wavelength [Masuda et al. 1988](https://doi.org/10.1016/0034-4257(88)90032-6).

Quantum detectors respond to IR by absorbing photons, such as Indium antimonide (InSb) or strained layer superlattice (SLS). Quantum detectors have faster responses than non-quantum detectors but need cooling to cryogenic temperatures to operate.

    "Instruments using remote sensing include thermal cameras, pyrometers, and radiometers. Usually, thermal cameras and pyrometers output a temperature with low accuracy (the best I found so far is ±2°C for a thermal camera around 500€). However, combined measurements and intelligent post-processing may significantly increase accuracy [Robinson & Donjon 2010](https://doi.org/10.1080/1023673031000080385), [Zhang & Wang 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/s22051872). **Not great as a citation, it's MDPI, but I found the idea interesting.**\n",

    "- **Temporal resolution**: The frame rate describes how many images per second the camera can collect. It will depend on the detector type. A microbolometer typically has a frame rate of 50 Hz.  \n",
    "- **Spatial resolution**: It will depend on the distance from the camera and on the camera's instantaneous field of view (FOV) and resolution (number of pixels).  \n",
    "- **Sensitivity**: Also called Noise Equivalent Differential Temperature (NEDT), sensitivity is the minimum temperature difference a camera can resolve. A camera with good sensitivity detects subtle temperature changes. It is different from accuracy.  \n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Imaging is not the final camera output. Usually, thermal cameras output thermal measurements instead of radiation measurements. IR cameras are used to track groundwater discharge by looking either at qualitative measurements (temperature difference) (see Figure [Briggs et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.3390/w14010011)) or absolute values given by the manufacturer with an accuracy of 2°C [Haer et al. 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169415007428).\n",

    "\n",
    "The mechanical bathythermograph was a historical oceanographic instrument extensively used from the 1930s to 1970s for measuring temperature profiles with depth. This torpedo-shaped device revolutionized ocean temperature measurements by providing continuous profiles rather than discrete point measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "The MBT operates on mechanical principles using a bourdon tube system. As the instrument descends through the water column, water pressure causes a bourdon tube to deflect proportionally to depth, while a bimetallic element responds to temperature changes. These mechanical movements are transferred through a linkage system to a stylus that traces curves on a smoked glass slide, creating a permanent record of temperature versus depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measurement process\n",
    "\n",
    "The MBT is lowered from a ship on a wire cable to predetermined depths (typically 100-400m). During descent and ascent, the stylus continuously records temperature and pressure on the glass slide. After retrieval, the smoked glass slide is processed and the traces are read using specialized equipment to extract temperature-depth profiles. The data requires correction for instrument lag and wire angle effects.\n",

    "**Modern rosette method**: A rosette sampler equipped with Niskin bottles and CTD sensors is deployed. Water samples are collected at predetermined depths while the CTD continuously records temperature, conductivity, and pressure. This provides both discrete samples for laboratory analysis and continuous profiles.\n",
