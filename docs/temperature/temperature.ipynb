    "Ocean temperature ranges between -2°C and 40°C globally. It controls the evolution of ocean circulation, climate systems, and marine habitats. Temperature determines water density (together with salinity and pressure) and hence conditions oceanic circulation. It reflects the amount of energy stored and absorbed by oceans [Cheng et al. 2020]. \n",

Modern satellites can achieve horizontal resolution down to about 100 m. However, not all satellites reach this resolution. Measurements are more difficult near coasts and under clouds. Surface measurements fill in the gaps. They are selected based on their characteristics (balancing coverage versus temporal resolution).\n",

    "Below the surface, temperature profiles change in time and space (Figure [2](#seatemperature_profile)). This is due to seasonal variation of heat input and mixing processes of various temporal scales. The strongest vertical temperature gradient occurs in the first tens of meters below the surface. This region is called the thermocline. Thermocline strength increases seasonally with sun and atmospheric heat input variations. A temperature change of 10°C between 0 m and 80 m depth is easily observed in summer. At the coast, in water depths less than 200 m, a secondary weaker thermocline forms near the bottom due to bottom friction. At greater depths, temperature slowly decreases. Variations of 10°C occur over more than 1 km depth (Figure [2](#seatemperature_profile)). At great depths, water pressure affects temperature measurements. This relates to the heat capacity of the water mass. Therefore, a potential temperature must be defined for accurate analysis.\n",

    "### Thermistor : To do \n",
    "The word \"thermistor\" derives from the description \"thermally sensitive resistor\". Thermistor is a fundamental electrical component whos electrical resistance changes with temperature and was first discoverred in 1833 by M.Faraday. At this time, the mass productino of thermistor was challenging so that the commercial production only started in the 1930s. The development of high-performance semiconductor in the late 20th century significantly increase the sensor sensitivity precision and increased the operational temperature. Today thermistor is used for a wide range of application and is the main type of temperature sensor used in oceanographic measurements. \n",

    "Thermocouples are robust and versatile sensors with a fast time response (of the order of the milliseconds). The sensor can be smaller than a few micrometers and flexible, so they are used in a wide range of applications [Zhang et al. 2022]. In oceanography, thermocouples are not usually used because they require analog elctronics which can be challenging to construct even though they can offer an interesting spatial resolution and fast response [Nash et al. 1999]. A detailed description of thermocouple construction can be found in [Marmorino et al. 1977].\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{dropdown} ▶ Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermocouples work based on the Seebeck effect, where a voltage is generated at the junction of two dissimilar metals when there is a temperature difference between the junction and the ends of the metals. Electrons spontaneously migrate towards the colder area and, because the two metals have distinct electrical properties the voltage is different between the two ends of each metal. The potential difference between the two metals is called the contact electromotive force (EMF). The EMF produced depends on the metals and is proportional to the temperature difference. No voltage is measured if the two metals are similar or if there is no temperature difference. Standard couples of metals are usually used (see [tcaus website](https://www.tcaus.com.au/thermocouple/thermocouple-standards.html) for more information on thermocouple standards).\n",

The reference temperature is then used to compensate the voltage measured at the \"hot\" end. Finally, the thermocouple is either calibrated or its calibration curve is used to obtain the \"hot\" temperature knowing the voltage output. The voltage measured is a few mV (Figure [Thermocouple voltage](#thermocouple_reference)) and is usually amplified, which adds noise. \n",

(1999) the final temperature output was 102.4 Hz. Thermocouples showed less variance than thermistors in turbulent patches within large temperature-gradient signal. In both studies, the amplified noise limited the measurement accuracy. Future improvements in operational amplifiers could enhance performance (see Figure 12 in [Nash et al. 1999]). \n",

    "Usually, thermal cameras and pyrometers output a temperature with low accuracy (the best I found so far is ±2°C for a thermal camera around 500€). However, combined measurements and intelligent post-processing may significantly increase accuracy [Robinson & Donjon 2010](https://doi.org/10.1080/1023673031000080385), [Zhang & Wang 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/s22051872). Radiometers measure radiance over several thin spectral bands and provide radiation output. Radiometers are expensive and relatively massive instruments used on satellites or on Earth to measure sea and atmospheric properties. More information about radiometers can be found [Apogee instrument website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkW3SULYkM&t=422s) and in the [Flir website](http://www.flirmedia.com/MMC/THG/Brochures/T559243/T559243_EN.pdf).

    "### General principle of thermal radiation \n",
    "\n",
    "Remote temperature measurement aims to capture the intensity of long wavelength emissions from an observed body. Matter emits electromagnetic radiation at different wavelenghts which constitutes a spectrum (see Figure [solar spectrum](#Solar_spectrum)). Compared to contact sensing, thermal radiation is a non-intrusive measurement, which makes it ideal for SST measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, all remote temperature instrument measure radiation over a given range of wavelength. The range is selected based on the expected temperature of the body since the peak emission depends on the body temperature and shifts towards shorter wavelengths as temperature increases ([Wien's displacement law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law)). For example, the sun, at a temperature of 5900 K, has a maximum luminous intensity in the “visible” wavelengths (from a human point of view), whereas SST whose temperature is between 2 and 32°C does not spontaneously emit in the visible range; but in the infrared and microwave wavelength range. \n",
    "\n",
    "The radiation captured by the instrument is a combination of what is emitted by the body of interest and the environment. When looking at the SST, measurements also capture what the atmosphere emits (and all the other bodies that may be present on the way). The atmosphere emits where it absorbs sunlight (see Figure [solar spectrum](#Solar_spectrum)). Usually, filters are chosen between 10.5–12.5 μm (atmospheric window) to avoid atmospheric absorption bands without being too broad. Once the radiation is corrected, one can compute the temperature associated with the emission using [Stefan-Boltzmann's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan–Boltzmann_law). The approximations made at this stage are : 1) the SST mostly emits in the measured range 2)the spectrum is approximated by the [black-body spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation), described by Planck's Law. \n",
    "\n",
    "To correct the first approximation, measurements can be made in several bands (such as in satellite measurements). The second approximation is corrected by using a correction factor called the [emissivity](https://thermalprocessing.com/what-pyrometer-users-need-to-know/). Sea surface emissivity must be appropriately taken into account depending on the wavelength [Masuda et al. 1988](https://doi.org/10.1016/0034-4257(88)90032-6). More information can be found in [DeWitt & Nutter 1988].\n",

    "The sensor is oriented at a fixed angle towards the object. The lens and filter focus the thermal energy onto the detector. The lens is made of materials highly transparent to IR radiation (such as Germanium or Chalcogenide). If relevant, the lens should be [carefully chosen](https://oem.flir.com/fr-fr/learn/discover/Considerations-for-Thermal-Lens-Selection/) and its effect may be considered. The detector converts the thermal energy into an electric signal. Different types of detectors are used (microbolometers, thermopiles or quantum detectors). A microbolometer is commonly used, it has the slowest response (~10ms) and is the cheapest option. More information can be found in [\"The Ultimate Infrared Handbook for R&D Professionals\"](http://www.flirmedia.com/MMC/THG/Brochures/T559243/T559243_EN.pdf). The electric signal is amplified and can either be radiation (the output : this is radiometric measurements) or processed (temperature : thermographic measurements). This is an option in radiometers and thermal camera and IR thermometers \n",

The main sources of error are : inaccuracy in the representation of the sea surface spectrum (the sea surface is not a black body and its emissivity needs to be characterized) and in the quantification of atmospheric radiation. The lens contribution may also affect the final result (see thermal camera section).\n",

    "#### Thermal camera\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermal cameras cost around 160–1500€ and provide temperature measurements over a surface. Cameras can be lightweight (153g), wireless, or plugged into smartphones. Cameras can be technically challenging, and training may be needed to fully handle them. On websites, accuracy is either given as an absolute value and is of the order of 1-2°C or as a proportion of the measurements (±2% of reading).\n",

    "- **Temporal resolution**: The frame rate describes how many images per second the camera can collect. It will depend on the detector type. A microbolometer typically has a frame rate of 50 Hz.  \n",
    "- **Spatial resolution**: It will depend on the distance from the camera and on the camera's instantaneous field of view (FOV) and number of pixels chosen (lowest is around 336x256).  \n",
    "- **Sensitivity**: Also called Noise Equivalent Differential Temperature (NEDT), sensitivity is the minimum temperature difference a camera can resolve. The typical value is 20mK. It is different from accuracy.  \n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Usually, thermal cameras output thermal measurements instead of radiation measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "IR cameras are used to track groundwater discharge by looking either at qualitative measurements (temperature difference) [Briggs et al. 2021] or absolute values given by the manufacturer with an accuracy of 2°C [Hare et al. 2015].
