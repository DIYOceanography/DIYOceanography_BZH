    "Temperature is a state variable, i.e. it is one of the parameters defining the thermodynamic equilibrium state of a system, and is an intensive property as it is independent of the quantity of matter in that system. This makes it a crucial variable to measure when determining the state of a system, whatever the field of application.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ocean, temperature range between -2°C and 40°C and conditions the evolution of ocean circulation, climate system and marine habitats. It determines water density (in conjunction with salinity and pressure) and reflects the amount of energy stored and absorbed by oceans [Chang et al. 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00376-020-9283-7). [Sea surface temperature](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-sea-surface-temperature) (SST), [ocean heat](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-ocean-heat) and [marine heat waves](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-marine-heat-waves) are clear climate change indicators directly linked to temperature measurements. Temperature is the easiest ocean property to measure. Except for deep observations, temperature measurements can be easy to handle and useful to coastal communities. The combinaison of temperature measurements over a large areas shows the trend of temperature in time and space [Chang et al. 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00376-020-9283-7) which can be used to study and predict marine life migration [Womersley et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-024-02129-5). Therefore an accurate use of temperature measurements by anyone going at sea is beneficial at a large scale.\n",

    "Temperature depends on depth, location and time, so different measurements are regularly needed depending on the area of interest. Sea surface temperature *add something here*. At great depths, water pressure induces a variation in temperature measured in relation to the heat capacity of the water mass in question, so a potential temperature must be defined. It's also important to note that the definition of a temperature value is based on a standard (first defined in 1700 by Mr. Celsius, who defined 0°C as the temperature at which fresh water at 0m altitude boils), and these standards have changed over time. This question is particularly important to compare historical measurements. Temperatures specified using the International Practical Temperature Scale 1968 (IPTS-68) differ from ITS-90 by up to 0.01°C over the range of oceanographic interest.\n",

    "## Remote sensing: Thermal radiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote temperature measurement captures the intensity of infrared wavelength emissions from an observed area. Matter emits electromagnetic radiation over a spectrum (see Figure ...). Compared to contact sensing, thermal radiation is a non-intrusive measurement, which makes it ideal for SST measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The peak emission depends on the temperature and shifts towards shorter wavelengths as temperature increases ([Wien's displacement law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law)). For example, the sun, at a temperature of 5900 K, has a maximum luminous intensity in the “visible” wavelengths (from a human point of view), whereas a human does not spontaneously emit in the visible range; at around 37°C, their maximum intensity is in the infrared wavelength range.\n",
    "\n",
    "A body's spectrum can be approximated using a few hypotheses by the [black-body spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation), described by Planck's Law. The integration of the black-body spectrum over the wavelengths (and [solid angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_angle) if needed) gives the power per unit surface emitted by the black-body. Finally, you can compute the temperature associated with the emission using [Stefan-Boltzmann's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan–Boltzmann_law) and [emissivity](https://thermalprocessing.com/what-pyrometer-users-need-to-know/). Sea surface emissivity must be appropriately taken into account depending on the wavelength [Masuda et al. 1988](https://doi.org/10.1016/0034-4257(88)90032-6).

    "The sensor is oriented at a fixed angle towards the object. The lens and filter focus infrared energy onto the detector. The lens is made of materials highly transparent to IR radiation (such as Germanium or Chalcogenide). If relevant, the lens should be [carefully chosen](https://oem.flir.com/fr-fr/learn/discover/Considerations-for-Thermal-Lens-Selection/) and its effect may be considered. The detector converts the IR energy into an electric signal. The electric signal is amplified and can either be a raw output (radiometric measurements) or processed (thermographic measurements).\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The detectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The detector transforms the thermal energy into electrical energy. Different types of detectors can be used, which will modify the cost and the time response of the instrument. Usually, the microbolometer (change of electrical resistance) is the cheapest solution. Thermopiles (made of several thermocouples) and MEMS thermopile are also used. Quantum detectors respond to IR by absorbing photons, such as Indium antimonide (InSb) or strained layer superlattice (SLS). Quantum detectors have faster responses than non quantum detectors but need cooling to cryogenic temperatures to operate. More information can be found in [\"The Ultimate Infrared Handbook for R&D Professionals\"](http://www.flirmedia.com/MMC/THG/Brochures/T559243/T559243_EN.pdf).\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Radiometric measurements allow for an accurate measurement of the SST when careffully post processed. The main source of errors are a good representation of the sea surface spectrum (the sea surface is not a black body and itsemissivity needs to be caracterized) and the atmsopheric radiation. The sensor not only capture the object radiation but also radiation from the environment and atmosphere emits where it absorbs sunlight (see solar spectrum Figure). Usually, filters are chosen between 10.5–12.5 μm (atmospheric window) to avoid atmospheric absorption bands without being too broad. The lens contribution may also contribute to final result (see thermal camera section).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instruments using remote sensing are thermal cameras, pyrometers, and radiometers. Usually thermal camera and pyrometers output a temperature with low accuracy (best I found so far is ±2°C for a thermal camera around 500€). However, combined measurements and intelligent post processing may significantly increased the accuracy [Robinson & Donjon 2010](https://doi.org/10.1080/1023673031000080385),[Zhang & Wang 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/s22051872) **Pas ouf comme citation, c'est MDPI mais j'ai trouvé l'idée interessante**)\n",

IR camera are used to track groundwater discharge by looking either at qualitative measurement (temperature difference) (see Figure [Briggs et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.3390/w14010011)).

Instruments (such as pyrometers or medical IR thermometer) cost between 10-1000€. IR sensors can also be bought outside an instrument and integrate. Examples of [IR sensors](https://www.melexis.com/en/product/MLX90614/Digital-Plug-Play-Infrared-Thermometer-TO-Can) with 0.5°C accuracy and can be found around 23 USD.
